 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a used car dataset to understand the key factors that influence car prices. Using Python and data visualization techniques, the analysis uncovers patterns, trends, and relationships between price and other features such as mileage, year, fuel type, engine size, and transmission.

 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about used cars with the following columns:

* **model** – Car model name
* **year** – Manufacturing year
* **price** – Car price
* **transmission** – Manual / Automatic / Semi-Auto
* **mileage** – Distance driven
* **fuelType** – Petrol / Diesel / Hybrid / Electric
* **tax** – Road tax
* **mpg** – Miles per gallon
* **engineSize** – Engine capacity

---

 🎯 Objectives

* Understand the distribution of car prices
* Analyze the relationship between mileage and price
* Compare prices across fuel types and transmissions
* Identify factors that have the strongest impact on car price
* Detect outliers and pricing patterns

---

📈 Analysis & Visualizations

The following visual analyses were performed:

* Price distribution using histograms
* Mileage vs Price scatter plots
* Price comparison by fuel type (boxplots)
* Average price by transmission (bar charts)
* Engine size vs price relationship
* Year vs price (depreciation analysis)
* Correlation heatmap for numerical features

---

 🔍 Key Insights

* Car price generally **decreases as mileage increases**
* **Newer cars** tend to have higher prices
* Cars with **larger engine sizes** are usually more expensive
* **Automatic transmission** cars have higher average prices
* Fuel type plays a significant role in pricing

 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook
